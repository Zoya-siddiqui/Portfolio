                  The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've never been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's js, UI, java  or CSS. I’ve been designing with computers since the day I first opened vs code. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Fast forward to 2023 and I’ve tried it all, it was very new to me  but i tried my best i gave my all the effeorts to Web Design, Animation, HTML/CSS and js  Everything I have done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today.

                  What excites me most about being a webdeveloper is being able to design and create things that have purpose to explore. It goes beyond designing buttons and websites and involves having a passion for designing experiences and solutions that help people, whether it's helping them make better websited themselves online, or buy something online. Leaning into customer insight and understanding their needs, finding the right problems to solve, delivering solutions as quickly as possible, learning from those and then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great web disigner.

                  This is one of my favourite quotes (by Peter Drucker):
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="quote">“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This resonates so deeply with me because I have no desire to make pretty things just for the sake of it. Some people love that! But it's not for me. I only want to make, design or build ideas and websites that are real, that matter and have an impact in the world.
